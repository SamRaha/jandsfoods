-   About Us:
    Established in 1977 by our founders, Tony Stevens and Bernard Hudson, J and S Foods began by distributing pies and cooked meats to customers throughout Yorkshire. From the outset, it was their core aim to provide a service that could not be beat, whether it was an emergency order or a reliable daily delivery.
    J and S Foods has become an established and versatile business, supplying the catering industry for over 44 years. Throughout our years in operation, we have supplied cafes, restaurants, schools, care homes, street food stalls and festivals. Although our customers have changed and the products we sell have greatly diversified, our focus on building relationships and providing unbeatable service has remained core to the company.
    The company is now owned by Tony and Bernard’s sons, Michael Stevens and John Hudson. After working in the business for many years, they now apply their knowledge and experience to provide a foodservice that adapts to the needs of the customers. We are still the same family run business established all those years ago, with Michael’s son, Matthew, now working in the business.
    We are proud to have customers up and down the country to keep us busy; whether that is supplying festivals and events or delivering wholesale food to our long-standing customers here in Leeds. Get in touch today to see how we can help you and your business.
